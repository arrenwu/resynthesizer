v3.0 for GIMP API 3.0

The outer plugins are in Scheme rather than Python.

The outer plugins and engine are ported to the GIMP API v3.

The user interface plugin (the control panel)
is in Scheme instead of C and Gtk.

The build system is meson instead of GNU automake.

Tests are revised, with new reference images (different from v2.0.)

Fixes for high-bit depth images.
The engine works in 8-bit depth, with loss of precision.

The Resynthesizer suite now accepts INDEXED images (having a palette.)
Results depend on the order of the palette being perceptual e.g. grayscale or "Sepia."

The "Sharpen" and "Enlarge and Sharpen" plugins are obsolete: 
not ported to Scheme and not installed.
They were little used.

The default build is non-threaded.
